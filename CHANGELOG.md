## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Fat-Package Pre-Bundled Native Binaries**: Npm package now pre-bundles native compiled binaries for all 5 major platforms (`darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `win32-x64.exe`) inside `bin/binaries/`.
- **Zero-Latency Offline Execution**: Invocations immediately execute the matching bundled native binary with zero network requests, zero `curl`/`powershell` execution, and complete air-gap/corporate-proxy support.
- **Supply-Chain Security Hardening**: Completely eliminated runtime unverified binary downloads, external shell executions, and supply-chain scanner red flags.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Architecture-Aware Binary Bootstrapping**: `bin/run.js` verifies binary compatibility and automatically downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases into `~/.cache/garden/bin/`.
- **SKILL.md Self-Bootstrapping Section 0**: Added clear instructions for agents encountering a missing `garden` CLI to run `npm install -g @axiomantic/garden`.
- **GitHub Actions CI & Release Workflows**: Added automated cross-platform builds and release workflows.

### Fixed
- **Pure Universal NPM Package**: Excluded host binaries from npm package, publishing universal runner with automatic release provisioning.
